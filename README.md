# Event Management App circuit

My project is an Event Planner that allows users to create and plan their events. Events can be anything from weddings, concerts, parties, work and/or school deadlines, todo lists, and much more. This application is incredibly flexible and designed to keep the user organized, by allowing them to create a deadline, that initiates a countdown to that event in real-time. In addition, once a user creates an event, they will have the option to create tasks that allows them to prepare for the event. Once the user creates a task another countdown begins. This countdown, however, is for each task that is created. So if you have only so much time to get a certain task done, such as ordering flowers for a wedding or a cake for a party, this can come in very handy. The application becomes more like a virtual assistant.

* App might have event sharing with others or via social media.
