            <p>
            My project is an Event Planner that allows users to create and plan their events. 
            Events can be anything from weddings, concerts, parties, work and/or school deadlines, 
            todo lists, and much more. This application can be flexible and it is designed to keep 
            the user organized, by allowing them to create a deadline, creates tasks and their own events.
            * In addition, once a user creates an event, they will have the 
            option to create tasks that allows them to prepare for the event. Once the user creates 
            a task another countdown begins. This countdown, however, is for each task that is created. 
            So if you have only so much time to get a certain task done, such as ordering flowers for 
            a wedding or a cake for a party, this can come in very handy. The application becomes more 
            like a virtual assistant.
